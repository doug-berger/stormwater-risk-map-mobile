         <h3 class="flood-rec-header"> Elevate Important Documents and Equipment  </h3>
        <p class="flood-rec-text"> Elevating important documents, equipment, and supplies can help you minimize damage during a flood. Move expensive inventory from 
        the basement to an upper floor, if possible. Consider digitizing important documents or moving them to a safe location off-site. If that is not feasible, a 
        portable waterproof storage box can preserve essential documents. This should include evacuation routes, emergency contacts, and a plan for securing your property.</p>

        <h3 class="flood-rec-header"> Elevate Mechanical Systems </h3>
        <p class="flood-rec-text"> Raising your property or critical mechanical systems above flood water levels can prevent damage, while also lowering your flood insurance premiums. 
        Learn more about potential retrofitting projects at <a href="https://www.floodhelpny.org/en/flood-retrofits" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FloodHelpNY</a>. </p>

         <h3 class="flood-rec-header"> Document Costly Equipment and Inventory </h3>
        <p class="flood-rec-text"> Take photos of important equipment, inventory, and supplies before and after a flooding event. This will make it easier to get assistance 
        from insurance or FEMA disaster recovery funds or other relief funds that become available. </p>

         <h3 class="flood-rec-header"> Purchase a Submersible Water Pump </h3>
        <p class="flood-rec-text"> A submersible water pump and hose can be used to prevent floodwater from accumulating inside a building or to remove water after 
        a flood event. This reduces damage to the building and supplies and speeds up the recovery process.</p>`;

        <p class="flood-rec-text"> Work with your neighbors to keep storm drains clear of debris, or call in problems to 311. You can also report issues through 
        the <a href="https://portal.311.nyc.gov/article/?kanumber=KA-01084" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">online portal</a>. This helps to prevent the accumulation of water during and after a rainstorm. </p>

        <h3 class="flood-rec-header"> Install rain barrels to capture water </h3>
        <p class="flood-rec-text"> You can take a step to facilitate roof water drainage by installing a rain barrel to capture storm water and drain it after a storm. This helps your property and your downhill neighbors stay dry. 
        They also help to reduce the amount of stormwater runoff that enters the sewer system, which can help to prevent basement flooding in your neighborhood.
