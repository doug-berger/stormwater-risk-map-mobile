<h3 class="flood-rec-header"> Purchase Flood Insurance </h3> 
<p class="flood-rec-text"> Flood protection is not included in standard homeowners or renter's insurance, but can be obtained as a separate policy. 
Go to <a href="https://floodhelpny.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FloodHelpNY</a> to learn more about flood insurance. Even if you are not in a FEMA flood zone, you may be at risk from stormwater flooding.</p>

<h3 class="flood-rec-header"> Get Emergency Notifications Through Notify NYC </h3>
<p class="flood-rec-text"> Download the <a href="https://a858-nycnotify.nyc.gov/notifynyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Notify NYC</a> 
app or create an account to get the information you want to receive, the way you want to receive it. Registration offers 16 notification types, 
including emergency and basement flooding alerts. </p>

 <h3 class="flood-rec-header"> Elevate Important Documents and Equipment  </h3>
<p class="flood-rec-text"> Elevating important documents, equipment, and supplies can help you minimize damage during a flood. Move expensive inventory from 
the basement to an upper floor, if possible. Consider digitizing important documents or moving them to a safe location off-site. If that is not feasible, a 
portable waterproof storage box can preserve essential documents. This should include evacuation routes, emergency contacts, and a plan for securing your property.</p>

<h3 class="flood-rec-header"> Elevate Mechanical Systems </h3>
<p class="flood-rec-text"> Raising your property or critical mechanical systems above flood water levels can prevent damage, while also lowering your flood insurance premiums.

 <h3 class="flood-rec-header"> Document Costly Equipment and Inventory </h3>
<p class="flood-rec-text"> Take photos of important equipment, inventory, and supplies before and after a flooding event. This will make it easier to get assistance 
from insurance or FEMA disaster recovery funds or other relief funds that become available. </p>

 <h3 class="flood-rec-header"> Purchase a Submersible Water Pump </h3>
<p class="flood-rec-text"> A submersible water pump and hose can be used to prevent floodwater from accumulating inside a building or to remove water after 
a flood event. This reduces damage to the building and supplies and speeds up the recovery process.</p>
