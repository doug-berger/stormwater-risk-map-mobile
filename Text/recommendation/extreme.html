<h3 class="flood-rec-header"> Install Backflow Preventer Valve </h3>
<p class="flood-rec-text"> Using backwater valves, check valves, and drain plugs prevents sewer water from 
rising into a residence or business through its basement plumbing during heavy rain. Homeowners in one- to four-family 
buildings may be eligible for low- to no-interest loans to install backwater valves through NYC's Department of Housing and 
Preservation Development <a href="https://sustainableneighborhoodsny.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Resilient Retrofits program</a>. </p>

   <h3 class="flood-rec-header"> Elevate Important Documents and Equipment  </h3>
<p class="flood-rec-text"> Elevating important documents, equipment, and supplies can help you minimize damage during a flood. Move expensive inventory from 
the basement to an upper floor, if possible. Consider digitizing important documents or moving them to a safe location off-site. If that is not feasible, a 
portable waterproof storage box can preserve essential documents. This should include evacuation routes, emergency contacts, and a plan for securing your property.</p>

 <h3 class="flood-rec-header"> Document Costly Equipment and Inventory </h3>
<p class="flood-rec-text"> Take photos of important equipment, inventory, and supplies before and after a flooding event. This will make it easier to get assistance 
from insurance or FEMA disaster recovery funds or other relief funds that become available. </p>

 <h3 class="flood-rec-header"> Purchase Portable Flood Barriers  </h3>
<p class="flood-rec-text"> Purchase ready-made flood barriers and make a plan to deploy them in case of heavy rain or coastal flooding. Alternatively, 
keep materials, such as sandbags, plywood, plastic sheeting, and lumber, on hand to help protect your business.</p>

 <h3 class="flood-rec-header"> Purchase a Submersible Water Pump </h3>
<p class="flood-rec-text"> A submersible water pump and hose can be used to prevent floodwater from accumulating inside a building or to remove water after 
a flood event. This reduces damage to the building and supplies and speeds up the recovery process.</p>

<h3 class="flood-rec-header"> Get Emergency Notifications Through Notify NYC </h3>

<h3 class="flood-rec-header"> Clean Catch Basins </h3>
<p class="flood-rec-text"> Work with your neighbors to keep storm drains clear of debris, or call in problems to 311. You can also report issues through 
the <a href="https://portal.311.nyc.gov/article/?kanumber=KA-01084" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">online portal</a>. This helps to prevent the accumulation of water during and after a rainstorm. </p>

<h3 class="flood-rec-header"> Install rain barrels to capture water </h3>
<p class="flood-rec-text"> You can take a step to facilitate roof water drainage by installing a rain barrel to capture storm water and drain it after the storm. For more information, see New York City Department of Environmental Protection's
